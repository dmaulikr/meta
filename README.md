# Universe as a Code 

E = m * love ^ 2

## WTF is this?

Example code that can help with a steep learning curve of Objective-C. It uses mostly Inheritance and Delegation patterns, is ready for multiple delegation and intentionally lacks messaging.

This is nothing more than an Objective-C code, that emerged while sitting in a pub over a beer. However:

It is based on a simple requirements, it must implement: Love, peace & eternity.

1. Eternity stands for relative duration (a lifespan).

2. Love is shared by God with all Entities (only Living entities are implemented so far, all others (like elements) should implementy DestinyDelegate as well). Love can be added back to god by praying/sacrificing, whatever it is (casualties are NOT required, especially living entities are not to be sacrificed EVER because it negatively affects overall love).

3. Peace is reserved for future purposes.

* It simulates Universe with some Destiny (given lifetime), that gets bored after some time of being dead and performs a Big Bang.

* Each universe provides several dimensions and Gods as managers, that create Living Entities over these dimensions.

* Dimension dies with its entities.

* Dying entity returns remaining love to god.

* The more entities, the more love gets returned to God.
